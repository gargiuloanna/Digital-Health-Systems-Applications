# Digital-Health-Systems-Applications
Repository containing the code for the Digital Health Systems &amp; Applications Project, a.a. 2022/2023

The goal of the project is the realization of different applications to mimic processes of a Hospital Information System using the Coherent Dataset.
The objective is to interpret the information contained in the CSV files and translate it into FHIR records. These records need to be loaded on a FHIR server that needs to be installed and configured.
The applications simulate:
1.	Patient admission and registration;
2.	Order entry for analysis or investigation;
3.	Execution of an MRI analysis and loading of the corresponding DICOM file;
4.	CSV import.
